# Time Tracker 

is A task manager, also known as task management software, is a tool designed to help individuals, teams or companies organize, plan and track the progress of their activities. Here's an overview of how they generally work:

Task Registration: Users can create and register tasks to be performed. Each task usually includes information such as title, description, due date, priority, and other relevant information.

Organization by Project or List: Tasks can be organized into projects or lists, allowing a hierarchical structure for better management. This is especially useful when dealing with multiple related tasks.

Due Dates and Reminders: Task managers often allow you to set due dates for each task. Automatic reminders or notifications can be set up to alert users of impending deadlines.
